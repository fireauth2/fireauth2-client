# @fireauth2/core

This library provides shared, framework agnostic contract definitions and utilities for [FireAuth2](https://github.com/ekkolon/fireauth2) clients. It defines essential types and interfaces needed to ensure consistent communication between JavaScript clients that implement this contract and a [FireAuth2 Server](https://github.com/ekkolon/fireauth2) instance.
